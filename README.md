# SingleCellRNASeq_Analysis_NeuronsTypes_Organoids
This repository contains the python scripts developed by Stefano Magni (stefano.magni@uni.lu) to analyse single-cell RNA-Sequencing data of human midbrain-specific organoids. We published the results in Smits et al. (2020): "Single-cell transcriptomics reveals multiple neuronal cell types in human midbrain-specific organoids" (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03249-y).
