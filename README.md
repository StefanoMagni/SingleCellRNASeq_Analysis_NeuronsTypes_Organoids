# SingleCellRNASeq_Analysis_NeuronsTypes_Organoids
This repository contains the python scripts developed by Stefano Magni to analyse the Single-cell RNA-Sequencing data which we published in  "Single-cell transcriptomics reveals multiple neuronal cell types in human midbrain-specific organoids" (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03249-y)
