# SingleCellRNASeq_Analysis_NeuronsTypes_Organoids
This repository contains the python scripts developed by Stefano Magni (stefano.magni@uni.lu) to analyse single-cell RNA-Sequencing data of human midbrain-specific organoids. We published the results in Smits et al. (2020): "Single-cell transcriptomics reveals multiple neuronal cell types in human midbrain-specific organoids" (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03249-y). You are free to use our scripts and data according to the license available in the github folder. In case you do so, we would strongly appreciate if you would cite our manuscript above as appropriate.
